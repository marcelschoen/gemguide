AES has also changed in some respects, particularly if you are 
running MINT, with new messages and possibilities not available on the 
Atari ST.  I shall discuss some of these in a later section.

  I will not say much 
about creating an RSC file - you can refer to your own program's 
documentation for that.  (I use ResourceMaster 3.65.)

== in Overview

Menus will be dealt with in brief in their own section.  They are the simplest 
aspect of GEM, and easily included into our programs.  Menus are defined in the 
program's RSC file, and all we need to do is respond to a message indicating they 
have been selected.

Dialog boxes will be dealt with, also in brief, in their own section, although 
they can be very complex.  The main issue with dialog boxes is displaying them, 
and then retrieving any data the user has input. Dialog boxes are the only 
place you find widgets such as buttons, text fields and labels.  Again, dialog 
boxes are defined in the program's RSC file.

== TOS 4.0

TOS 4.0 and later AES's provide additional features and functionality.  I don't 
propose to cover many of these advanced features here, but the following are 
important for interacting nicely with MINT, and/or just cool to use.

=== Extra Events

shading, ontop etc.

=== Toolbars

using some widgets in a toolbar

=== Internal Menus

menus within a window

== Keyboard / Mouse Events

keyboard mouse events

== Menus

something about menus

== Dialogs

something about dialogs

=== Form Alerts

built in dialogs

=== Through RSC

boxes you build yourself

== Accessories

something about accessories

== Images

if I can work out how to use them

== Scrapboard

something about scrapboard

== Beyond this Guide ...

There are many topics beyond the scope of this guide.  In particular, there 
are special hooks/events for interacting with other common software, such as 
your own AES replacement (MyAES or XaAES), or desktop replacement (such as 
TeraDesk or Thing).  

More generally, there are systems such as:

* AV Protocols
* LGD (a shared library system for Atari software)
